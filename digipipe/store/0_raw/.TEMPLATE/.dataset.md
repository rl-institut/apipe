# Dataset: .TEMPLATE

This is a descriptive file for the raw dataset in this directory.

Naming convention: `<source_datasetname>` (lower case), e.g. for a dataset on
natural reserves by the Bundesamt f√ºr Naturschutz (BfN) you would name the dir
`bfn_natural_reserves` or similar.

## Description

Please provide at least a brief description:

- What is this dataset about?
- Are there any specific things worth to know? (apart from metadata that MUST be
  created, see below)

A quick and dirty description is better than no description.

## Metadata

Add a metadata for every dataset you put here for describing data with
machine-readable information. Adhere to the OEP Metadata v1.5.1. You can make
use the [Metadata creator](https://meta.rl-institut.de/meta_creator/151).

See the [.metadata.json](.metadata.json) file in this directory.

Alternatively, you can create them manually: follow
[this example](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/metadata/latest/example.json)
to understand how the fields are used. Field are described in detail in the
[Open Energy Metadata Description](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/metadata/v141/metadata_key_description.md).
Please verify that your metadata string is in compliance with the OEP Metadata
standard using the [OMI tool](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/omi).
If your metadata string is compliant, OMI puts the keys in the correct order
and  prints the full string (use `-o` option for export).
