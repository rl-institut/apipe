# Energy system Stadt-Land-Energie

The energy system in apipe is created using
[oemof-B3](https://github.com/rl-institut/oemof-B3).

## Download and copy the data

In order to parameterize the energy system model, you'll need to download the corresponding 
datasets from the OEP and copy them to `apipe/store/raw` and `apipe/store/datasets`, respectivley. 

Once this is done, you can parameterize and solve your energy system model by following the 
next steps. 

## Build the energy system

To test if everything works, you can run the test scenario with

```
snakemake -j1 make_esys_appdata
```


Empty scalars and time series can be created from the energy model setup with

```
snakemake -j1 create_empty_scalars
snakemake -j1 create_empty_ts
```

These prompts create empty csv files with scalars and time series in the
following directories:

- `store/datasets/esys_raw/data/scalars/`
- `store/datasets/esys_raw/data/time_series/`

To set up an empty energy system, the following prompt automatically writes
default scalar values (such as zero or NaN) to the empty scalars:

```
snakemake -j1 write_default_scalars
```
With this the file `empty_scalars.csv` is automatically updated and saved to:
`store/datasets/esys_raw/data/scalars/default_scalars.csv`

## Test the energy system

To test the solvability of the energy system, run

```
snakemake -j1 postprocessed_esys_appdata
```

which should result in an output like

```
[...]
INFO - Optimization successful...
INFO - Solved the model. Elapsed time: 0:00:00.291995
INFO - Model solved. Collecting results.
INFO - Results saved to store/appdata/esys/2045_scenario/optimized.
```

## FAQ
### Do default scalars defined in `write_default_scalars.yml` overwrite
`raw/technology_data/raw_cost_efficiencies.csv`?

Yes they do.
To change this. You can either:

1) Run once

```
snakemake -j1 make_esys_appdata
```
2) Navigate to `store/datasets/esys_raw/scalars`

```
cd store/datasets/esys_raw/scalars
```

3) Change the value in the file `default_scalars.csv`.

4) Run again:
```
snakemake -j1 make_esys_appdata
```

Alternatively:
1) Navigate to `store/raw/technology_data/raw_cost_efficiencies.csv`
```
cd store/raw/technology_data/raw_cost_efficiencies.csv
```
2) Update the values for those scalars you'd like to change
3) Delete the respective var_names from `write_default_scalars` within `write_default_scalars.yml`
4) Add var_names to `cost_efficiencies` within `write_default_scalars.yml`
5) Run
```
snakemake -j1 make_esys_appdata
```
